This is a web page for myself, as a to-do list I prefer to think of coding progress as goals.
I have added a clock and a timer to keep track of my day. 
I have two to-do lists, one for daily chores. one for weekly goals. 
setting weekly goals reduced micromgmt of the day. 

Creating two to-do lists had an unforseen set of road-blocks. Copying the code was not that simple. Almost everything in the html and Javascript 
needed to be renamed. Either way, this should work for what I need it. It is also responsive on mobile!

How to use:
Download full zip folder
Extract
Open folder in VS Code
Open the index.html
right click, Open Live Server

(You will require the Live Server Extention to untilize)
